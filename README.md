# Optimizing a website for Search Engines

## Project Description
I wanted to learn how to properly develop webpages for the modern world. One important factor is the ability for search engines to find and present your website to users. I wanted to practice by modifying a webpage previous written using only the div tag to instead use semantic tags. By using semantic tags instead of generic divs search engines will prioritize this site higher making it easier for users to find from a search engine. I learned the different semantic html tags and their appropiate uses.
